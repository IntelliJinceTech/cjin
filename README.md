# Hi, I'm Chris

Welcome to my portfolio. I hope it provides a brief overview of who I am and what I do.

**Link to project:** https://cjin.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

This portfolio was built with the building blocks of a webpage, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Lessons Learned:

Accessibility and responsiveness across different display sizes highlighted the lessons that I learned more about in this project. Being able to maintain cohesiveness within the webpage ranging from smartphones to desktops goes a long way to providing visitors/users with a usable experience.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
